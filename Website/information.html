          <p> Yala National Park is the most visited and second largest national park in Sri Lanka, bordering the Indian Ocean. 
              The park consists of five blocks, two of which are now open to the public, and also adjoining parks. 
              The blocks have individual names such as, Ruhuna National Park, and Kumana National Park or 'Yala East' for the adjoining area. 
              It is situated in the southeast region of the country, and lies in Southern Province and Uva Province. 
              The park covers 979 square kilometres and is located about 300 kilometres from Colombo. 
              Yala was designated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, and, along with Wilpattu was one of the first two national parks in Sri Lanka, 
              having been designated in 1938. The park is best known for its variety of wild animals. 
              It is important for the conservation of Sri Lankan elephants, Sri Lankan leopards and aquatic birds. 
              There are six national parks and three wildlife sanctuaries in the vicinity of Yala. Among the largest is Lunugamvehera National Park.
              The park is situated in the dry semi-arid climatic region and rain is received mainly during the northeast monsoon.

              <p> Sigiriya, also called Lion Rock or Lion Mountain, site in central Sri Lanka consisting of the ruins of an ancient stronghold that was 
                  built in the late 5th century CE on a remarkable monolithic rock pillar. The rock, which is so steep that its top overhangs the sides, 
                  rises to an elevation of 1,144 feet (349 metres) above sea level and is some 600 feet (180 metres) above the surrounding plain. The Sinhalese king Kashyapa I 
                  (reigned 477–495) built a palace in the shape of a monumental lion on the several acres of ground at the summit, intending it to be a safeguard against his 
                  enemies. However, the king was defeated in 495, and the palace fell into ruin. The site soon became a pilgrimage destination, however, and it is now a popular 
                  tourist spot. Visitors begin the final ascent to the top through the open paws of the lion, one of the few remaining portions of the palace that are still intact. 
                  Also notable are 21 rock paintings of apsaras (celestial singers and dancers). Sigiriya was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982.

          <p> Dambulla cave temple also known as the Golden Temple of Dambulla is a World Heritage Site in Sri Lanka, situated in the central part of the country. 
              This site is situated 148 kilometres east of Colombo, 72 kilometres north of Kandy and 43 km north of Matale Dambulla is the 
              largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers 160 m over the surrounding plains. 
              There are more than 80 documented caves in the surrounding area. Major attractions are spread over five caves, which contain statues and paintings. 
              These paintings and statues are related to Gautama Buddha and his life. There are a total of 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings 
              and four statues of gods and goddesses. The latter include Vishnu and the Ganesha. The murals cover an area of 2,100 square metres. 
              Depictions on the walls of the caves include the temptation by the demon Mara, and Buddha's first sermon. 
              Prehistoric Sri Lankans would have lived in these cave complexes before the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka as there are burial 
              sites with human skeletons about 2700 years old in this area, at Ibbankatuwa near the Dambulla cave complexes.

            <p>Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic or Sri Dalada Maligawa; commonly known as the ශ්‍රී දළදා මාළිගාව, is a Buddhist temple in Kandy, 
                Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. 
                Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the 
                governance of the country. The relic was historically held by Sinhalese kings. The temple of the tooth is a World Heritage Site mainly due to 
                the temple and the relic. Bhikkhus of the two particular chapters, the Malwathu chapters and Asgiri chapters conduct daily worship in the inner 
                chamber of the temple. Rituals are performed three times daily: at dawn, at noon, and in the evenings. On Wednesdays, there is a symbolic bathing 
                of the relic with a herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers called Nanumura Mangallaya; this holy water is believed to contain 
                healing powers and is distributed to those present. The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989, and by Liberation 
                Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998.

               the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument, which even after more 
               than 432 years maintains a polished appearance, due to extensive reconstruction work done by Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka. The fort has a 
               colourful history, and today has a multi-ethnic and multi-religious population. The Sri Lankan government and many Dutch people who still own some of 
               the properties inside the fort are looking at making this one of the modern wonders of the world. The heritage value of the fort has been recognized by 
               the UNESCO and the site has been inscribed as a cultural heritage UNESCO World Heritage Site under criteria iv, for its unique exposition of 
               "an urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European architecture and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries."
                The Galle Fort, also known as the Dutch Fort or the "Ramparts of Galle", withstood the Boxing Day tsunami which damaged part of coastal area Galle town.

             <p>Udawalawe National Park is a national park on the boundary of Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces in Sri Lanka. The park was created to provide a 
                 sanctuary for wild animals displaced by the construction of the Udawalawe Reservoir on the Walawe River, as well as to protect the catchment of 
                 the reservoir. The reserve covers 30,821 hectares of land area and was established on 30 June 1972. Before the designation of the national park, 
                 the area was used for shifting cultivation. The farmers were gradually removed once the national park was declared. The park is 165 kilometres from 
                 Colombo. Udawalawe is an important habitat for water birds and Sri Lankan elephants. It is a popular tourist destination and the third-most visited 
                 park in the country.

            <p> The Nine Arch Bridge also called the Bridge in the Sky, is a viaduct bridge in Sri Lanka. It is one of the best examples of 
                colonial-era railway construction in the country. The construction of the bridge is generally attributed to a local Ceylonese builder, 
                P. K. Appuhami, in consultation with British engineers. The chief designer and project manager of the 'upcountry railway line of Ceylon' 
                project was D. J. Wimalasurendra, a distinguished Ceylonese engineer and inventor. The designer of the viaduct was Harold Cuthbert Marwood of 
                Railway Construction Department of Ceylon Government Railway. The 1923 report titled "Construction of a Concrete Railway Viaduct in Ceylon" 
                published by the Engineering Association of Ceylon has details of all the records including the plans and drawings. It is located in Demodara,
                 between Ella and Demodara railway stations. The surrounding area has seen a steady increase of tourism due to the bridge's architectural ingenuity 
                 and the profuse greenery in the nearby hillsides.

                  classical-medieval Hindu temple complex in Trincomalee, a Hindu religious pilgrimage centre in Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. The most 
                  sacred of the Pancha Ishwarams of Sri Lanka, it was built significantly during the reign of the early Cholas and the Five Dravidians of 
                  the Early Pandyan Kingdom on top of Konesar Malai, a promontory overlooking Trincomalee District, Gokarna bay and the Indian Ocean. 
                  Its Pallava, Chola, Pandyan and Jaffna design reflect a continual Tamil Saivite influence in the Vannimai region from the classical period. 
                  The monument contains its main shrine to Shiva in the form Kona-Eiswara, shortened to Konesar. Connected at the mouth of the Mahavilli Ganga 
                  River to the footprint of Shiva at Sivan Oli Padam Malai at the river's source, the temple symbolically crowns the flow of the Ganges River 
                  from Shiva's head of Mount Kailash to his feet.
